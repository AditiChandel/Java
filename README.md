# Brick Breaker Game

This is a classic Brick Breaker game implemented in Java using Swing and AWT libraries.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to break all the bricks using a ball that bounces off a paddle. The player controls the paddle's horizontal movement using the left and right arrow keys. The ball bounces off walls, the paddle, and bricks. When the ball hits a brick, the brick is destroyed, and the player earns points. The game ends when all bricks are destroyed or the ball falls below the paddle.

3. Run the game:

4. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
5. Press the space bar to start the game, launch the ball, and pause/resume during gameplay.
6. Break all the bricks to win the game.
